    "# Storms in Barrier3D\n",
    "Storms in Barrier3D are be described by 3 variables: storm duration, the highest runup elevation (Rhigh), and the lowest runup elevation (Rlow). In this notebook, we describe how to generate a list of synthetic storms for use in Barrier3D following the methods of Wahl et al. (2016) for a copula-based multivariate sea-storm model (MSSM). The MSSM model is developed using wave hindcast and water-level data from the Virgina Coastal Reserve and accounts for interdependencies between these three variables. We then illustrate how the list of synthetic storms can be used to generate annual storm time series (i.e., many storms per model year) for use in Barrier3D. Most of the text below describing the MSSM is taken from the Supplementary Text of Reeves et al., 2021."

    "Within `multivariateSeaStorm.m`, we first process the data by removing the 365-day (1 yr) running median. This differs from the 30-day running median used in Wahl et al. (2016), namely because we desired to maintain seasonal trends and only account for non-stationarity in wave and water level parameters due to inter-annual and decadal variability. The median of the last 3 years is then applied to the entire time series such that the new time series is representative of the current climate. A year-by-year tidal analysis is performed using t_Tide (Pawlowicz et al., 2002) to obtain the tidal amplitude $\\eta_A$ and non-tidal residual $\\eta_{NTR}$. Lastly, the representative highest elevation of the landward margin of runup (Rhigh, i.e. the total water level) is calculated as the sum of the maximum 2% exceedance of runup, following Stockdon et al. (2006), and the contemporaneous (corrected) water level elevation from the tide gauge. The representative lowest runup elevation (Rlow), below which any part of the barrier is considered continuously subaqueous during a storm, is taken as Rhigh – swash/2 (Figure 1). While wave direction is processed as part of the MSSM, it is not required as input for Barrier3D and is therefore not discussed herein.\n",

    "Storm events are then extracted from the corrected time series using the same metrics as Wahl et al. (2016), i.e., we derive a set of storm events by conditioning on Hs. Events are identified as periods of 8 or more consecutive hours with deep-water significant wave heights greater than 2.1 m, or rather the minimum monthly averaged wave height for periods in which waters levels exceed the berm elevation (Figure 2). The remaining variables used to define the independent multivariate storm events for use in Barrier3D include $\\eta_A$, $\\eta_{NTR}$, $Tp$, and storm duration. We discard storms with concomitant values of surge that are negative and identify new storms when Hs drops below the 2.1 m threshold for 24 hours or more (cf. Li et al., 2014). This method results in 282 independent multivariate sea-storm events for the example inputs shown here.\n",

    "We *slightly* improve upon the copula-based approach of Wahl et al. (2016) for modeling the interdependencies between sea-storm variables through the use of vine copulas, a class of copulas that has been shown to outperform standard higher dimensional copulas in hydrologic applications (e.g., Daneshkhah et al., 2016; Jane et al., 2020) and does a slightly better job here. The MvCAT toolbox (Sadegh et al., 2017) is first used to find marginal distributions that best fit each variable ($\\eta_{NTR}$: Weibull; Hs and storm duration: Generalized Pareto; Tp: Generalized Extreme Value). The observed data are then transformed to the copula scale (the unit hypercube) by finding their rank and then rescaling the ranks by 1/(N+1) where N = 282 events. Using the VineCopula R package (Nagler et al., 2020), we fit a C-vine, D-vine, and t-Student copula (as used in Wahl et al. (2016)) to the transformed four-dimensional data set in order to identify the most suitable copula for modeling interdependencies (the program `mssmVines.R` is called from within Matlab). We found through comparison of Kendall’s correlation coefficient $\\tau$ that the C-vine best captures the underlying dependence structure. We then generate 20,000 random samples (quadruplets) from the C-vine copula and then use the inverse of the fitted marginal CDFs to transform the simulated data from unit hypercube space back to the original scale of the data. As the tidal amplitude varies within a restricted range, we sample $\\eta_A$ directly from its empirical CDF for each of the 20,000 synthetic storm events."

    "Once the list of synthetic storms has been created, it can be used to generate annual storm time series (i.e., zero to many storms per year) for use in Barrier3D. The storm time series can be created using one of three functions, all of which are located in `tools.input_files`:\n",
    "* `yearly_storms` - user specifies the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution, which is then used to select a random number of storms to be pulled from the MSSM list each year.\n",

The first example produces a storm time series with an average of 8.3 storms per model year; then, we shift the same storm distribution to the right to preferentially select storms with higher intensity (i.e., higher TWLs). Lastly, we create a time series of a 50 year return period storm for the Virgina Coastal Reserve. We estimate that a 50 year storm produces a maximum 2.0 m TWL (above MHW) using the NOAA Annual Exceedance Probability Curves at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/est/curves.shtml?stnid=8638863), which produces a TWL that is 0.5 m greater than the berm elevation."

The output storm time series from any of the three methods described above can optionally be saved to file (`bSave=True`) to initialize the model. Because the storm time series add stochasticity, it may be desireable for a user to run and then average many Barrier3D simulations, each utilizing a different storm time series (with no change in input parameters) without saving the storms to file. In this case, the user may simply initialize the model with a dummy storm time series, call one of the methods above, and replace the `StormSeries` variable.
