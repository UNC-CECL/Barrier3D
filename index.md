## A spatially explicit model of barrier evolution.

## About

Barrier3D resolves cross-shore and alongshore topographic variations and simulates the morphological evolution of a barrier segment over time scales of years to centuries. The model explicitly yet efficiently simulates dune evolution, storm overwash, and a dynamically evolving shoreface in response to individual storm events and sea-level rise.

Barrier3D is built with the Basic Model Interface (BMI; https://bmi.readthedocs.io/).

## Requirements and Installation

Barrier3D requires Python 3, and the libraries listed in the project's _requirements.txt_ file.

## Input Parameters

Barrier3D takes five input files:

1) `barrier3d-parameters.yaml`
    yaml-formatted text file containing initial values for all static and dynamic variables
2) `barrier3d-elevation.npy`
    Initial interior elevation grid
3) `barrier3d-storms.npy`
    Stochastically generated sequence of storms (generated by randomly sampling from a list of 10,000 synthetic storms)
4) `barrier3d-dunes.npy`
    Initial height of dune cells
5) `barrier3d-growthparam.npy`
    Alongshore varying growth rates for the dune domain

If desired, (3-5) can be generated within the model run script to create unique conditions for each run - e.g., a new storm series can be stochastically generated for each run instead of using the same storm history by drawing from the a single `barrier3d-storms.npy` file.
