## About

*Barrier3D* resolves cross-shore and alongshore topographic variations and simulates the morphological evolution of a barrier segment over time scales of years to centuries. The model explicitly yet efficiently simulates dune evolution, storm overwash, and a dynamically evolving shoreface in response to individual storm events and sea-level rise.

Barrier3D _v2_ is built with the Basic Model Interface (BMI; https://bmi.readthedocs.io/) and is structured such that the model class `Barrier3D` is contained within the package `barrier3d`. The _v2_ model can be implemented using a command line interface (see below). An example run script is also provided in `scripts/runB3d_BMI.py`. The _v1_ and _v2_ models produce identical output (see `scripts/plot_BMI_vs_V1.py`).

## Requirements 

Barrier3D requires Python 3, and the libraries listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

If you are a developer of *Barrier3D* you will also want to install
additional dependencies for running *Barrier3D*'s tests to make sure
that things are working as they should. These dependencies are listed
in `requirements-testing.txt` and `requirements-development.txt`.

## Installation

To install *Barrier3D*, first create a new environment in
which *Barrier3D* will be installed. This, although not necessary, will
isolate the installation so that there won't be conflicts with your
base *Python* installation. This can be done with *conda* as:

```
  $ conda create -n barrier3d-env python=3
  $ conda activate barrier3d-env
```

### From Source

After downloading the *Barrier3D* source code, run the following from
*Barrier3D*'s top-level folder (the one that contains *setup.py*) to
install *Barrier3D* into the current environment:

```
  $ pip install -e .
```

## Input Parameters

Barrier3D takes five input files:

1) `barrier3d-parameters.yaml`
    yaml-formatted text file containing initial values for all static and dynamic variables
    
2) `barrier3d-elevation.npy`
    Initial interior elevation grid
    
3) `barrier3d-storms.npy`
    Stochastically generated sequence of storms (generated by randomly sampling from a list of 10,000 synthetic storms)
    
4) `barrier3d-dunes.npy`
    Initial height of dune cells
    
5) `barrier3d-growthparam.npy`
    Alongshore varying growth rates for the dune domain

If desired, (3-5) can be generated within the model run script to create unique conditions for each run - e.g., a new storm series can be stochastically generated for each run instead of using the same storm history by drawing from the a single `barrier3d-storms.npy` file.

Using the command line interface, you can print a sample *Barrier3D* parameter file:

Other input files can be shown in a similar fashion: 

```
  $ b3d show [dunes|elevations|growthparam|parameters|storms]$
```

## Plotting

Plotting functions can be found in:

```
barrier3d/tools/plot.py
```


## Examples

To run a simulation using the sample input files described above, you first
need to create a set of sample files. This can be done by hand or by running
`b3d setup` to get a default set of parameters that you can then edit.
For example:

```
  $ mkdir example
  $ cd example
  $ b3d setup
```

This command has creates the input files listed above that you can then edit for your
simulation.  To run *Barrier3D* using this file:

```
  $ b3d run
```

Use the *--help* option to get help about other command line options.

An example python run script using the BMI class is provided in `scripts/runB3d_BMI.py`.
